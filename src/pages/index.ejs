            <p> 
                I’ve been the driving force behind a great variety and quantity of software built for both the market and internal audiences. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                I work with founders, product & engineering teams to delight users and iterate towards product/market fit. In 
                larger organizations, I build a common language and resolve across institutional boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                I practice and spread techniques that increase quality and velocity, and decrease costs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As an advisor and a practitioner, I'll share what I've learned shipping 2-3 applications EVERY year for nearly 25 years.

            <h1>Things to contact me for</h1>
            <ul>
    
            <li>Selecting the right cloud provider and right-sizing your cloud infrastructure. Choosing one <a href="https://hackernoon.com/founder-advice-choosing-the-right-cloud-infrastructure-can-make-a-big-difference" target="_blank">cloud</a> over another can be a major drag or an accellerant. They say companies over-provision by 30%. In my experience the wastage is much higher. Don't spend thousands of dollars a month unnecessarilly!</li>
             <li>Application modernization. Patterns and practices like micro-services, messaging, containerization, CI/CD... can be game changers or just box-ticking. I'll work with to create an actionable plan that ensures success and improvement.</li>
             <li>Adopting business process execution engines (like Camunda or jBPM) for application orchestration and outboarding business logic.</li>
             <li>Help with your elasticsearch journey; whether you are just es curious or need to tune the platform to get the maximal results.</li>
            <li>Growing up your ETL processes. I can transform your home-rolled processes into ones powered by Apache Beam and Airflow.  </li>
            <li>Building a first class engineering organization or help in choosing the right external partners. </li>
            <li>Evaluating new product/business ideas,  product envisioning, validation, and business model analysis. If I like your idea, and we like one another, maybe we can build it together!</li>
            <li>Evaluation of software and development capabilities for M&A; forensic analysis for legal procedings.</li>
