                The software game has changed. The strongest coders on your team are likely not humans any more!
            </p>   
            <p> 
                The fundamentals of product development are unchanged. We learn from our users, iterating our software to maximize value and delight. Listening, persuading, empathy, judgement, taste are even more important as the product development loop has sped up.
            </p>
            <p>
               I'll share what I've learned shipping applications EVERY year for more than 30 years. 
            </p>
       
            <h3>I'm currently open to an additional fractional CTO role!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Digging in with early stage founders to see whether there's a there there. I especially love working with people who see an opportunity for software to change how things work in their area of expertise.</li>
                <li>Getting you from 0 to 1, whether that means from idea to working software, from minimum viable product to minimum viable business, from boot-strapped to series A funding. We'll envision what's possible, establish criteria for success, and set a course. I'll guide and support you and your team on the way.</li>
                <li>Shifting your team to be product-centric, user focused; iterating and learning. They won't just build features but move you towards product/market fit.</li>
                <li>Maximizing the use of AI into your product development practice. There's tremendous leverage here, but also real pitfalls (especially if you're just starting out).</li>
                <li>Incorporating LLMs and machine learning into your existing products and helping you envisage whole new classes of applications. I'm still learning on this front, I look forward to learning together.</li>
              
            </ul>
         
            <h3>I'm also available for more punctual chores. </h3>
            <ul>
             <li>Application architecture review/remediation/modernization. Patterns and practices like micro-services, messaging, containerization, CI/CD... can be game changers or just box-ticking. In the age of AI agents they can be never-ending rabbit holes. I'll work with you to institute changes that result in measurable improvement in the speed at which your team delivers value.</li>
             <li>Review a code-base for VC and acquisition due diligence</li>
             <li>Quickly build a custom application that's suited to purpose, delightful, and sustainable,  Allow me to wrangle and project manage those LLMs so you don't end up with vibe code. </li>
             <li>Adopting business process execution engines (like Camunda or jBPM) for application orchestration, offloading business logic, and turning prompts into deterministic logic where it matters</li>
            <li>Evaluating new product/business ideas, product envisioning, validation, and business model analysis. If I like your idea, and we like one another, maybe we can build it together!</li>
