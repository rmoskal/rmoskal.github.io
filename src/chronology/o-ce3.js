  My client is a startup that handles outsourced clinical study management. This highly regulated and complex process can truly benefit from sophisticated software automation. They need to commit to an ongoing development effort to succeed. Yet it is difficult for a small startup to spend what it takes to build CTMS (clinical study management systems) using traditional development methods.

I strongly recommended building a CTMS system based on SharePoint technologies. SharePoint provides a strong foundation that supports collaboration, customization, work flow, and document management.

The bulk of our application consists in glue code that orchestrates SharePoint features such as lists, document libraries, and the permission model.

Though SharePoint is a super capable platform, there are certain aspects that make it seem a tad old-fashioned in this Web 2.0 world. We integrated technologies such as JQuery, LINQ, and the newest MS Charting control to make it even better.

Having built similar systems for other pharmaceutical clients, I was very pleased to be able to build such a powerful application with a quarter of the effort that might be required using traditional techniques.
