  I led the turn-around for the build of this high fashion/micro-blogging application. 

  Finding bits and pieces of technology with partial and often ill thought out attempts at integration, the CTO and I  quickly assembled a new team and moved forward with a hybrid mobile application using ionic, python to scrape product information, and node for a RESTFUL api. 

  Initially, I supervised both the python developers coding the scrapers and built out the development/deployment infrastructure. As the team coalesced, I was able to focus on building out the back end domain model and api as well as evolving the the product direction with the management team. Finally, I directed the work of an off-shore data science team to put in place the product search using ES.
