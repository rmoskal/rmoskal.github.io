  I led the turn-around of the development of this high fashion/micro-blogging application. The existing code base consisted of bits and pieces of technology with partial and often ill thought out attempts at integration.

  Worked with a competent CTO to quickly assemble a development team. We decided to continue development of a hybrid mobile application using ionic, python to scrape product information, and node for a RESTFUL api. We replaced a home-grown full text search system with elasticsearch. 

  Initially, I supervised both the python developers coding the scrapers and built out the development/deployment infrastructure. As the team callesced,   I was able to focus on building out the back end domain model and api as well as evolving the the product direction with the management team. Finally, I directed the work of an off-shore data science team to put in place the product search using ES.
  
  We were able to launch the application in a six month period.
