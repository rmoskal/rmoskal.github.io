  In my consultancy, all experimentation with development practices is driven solely by the need to provide my clients with more and more value. I do this by increasing software quality and decreasing time to market. On a practical level I simplify and regularize the way my team works (this includes not writing code whenever possible). If I’m sharing these practices it’s because they are helping me achieve these goals, and I think others may be interested.
