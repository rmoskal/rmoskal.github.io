  The group that created the on-line version of the IEEE magazine jumped ship leaving our partner in the lurch. Sometimes, the problem with java development is the abundance of riches, especially in the hands of an inxeperienced team. In reviewing the technology behind the magazine I found a snake pit: four web frameworks,  two different templating engines!

It was all too much. Plus, the original application dated from 2000. Many basic functions were built from scratch (and so were hard to evolve), whereas today we would turn to any number of open source frameworks to accomplish more in a sustainable manner.

Everyone was surprised to hear that my answer to requests for features was often “let's throw some shit out”. The home-grown blogging system was the first to go. We replaced it with a hosted version of Movable Type integrated with the main application via RSS and JSON. We replaced a rudimentary caching system with Akamai, eliminating pernicious errors that would crop up under heavy loads.

I successfully the mastered a complex technology stack to allow our partner to service an valuable clients needs and to expand the engagement.
