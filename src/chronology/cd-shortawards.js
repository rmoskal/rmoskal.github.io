This is an example of the sort of work I did around the time where I would work as an extra hand helping out a team with an established code base. It also shows that I know  a fair amount about  django, though in fact I don't care for nanny frameworks.

I merged the code for the agencies and individuals awards programs into one and helped to create a third contest type: Shorty Awards for Social Good.

I also worked a bit on evolving the data model and administrative interface for their other business: <a href="https://muckrack.com">https://muckrack.com</a>. Primarily, I made fancy tweaks to the django administrative interface.

django-admin is great. I've used it to create internal tools many times.  flask-admin is almost as nice and has the advantage of not needing django.
