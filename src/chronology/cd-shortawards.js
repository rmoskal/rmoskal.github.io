  I merged two versions of the awards site (agencies and individuals) and helped support the creation of a third contest type: Shorty Awards for Social Good.

Provided on-going support as the company stages their yearly awards.

Also worked a bit to evolve the data model and administrative interface for their other product: https://muckrack.com/. Primarily, I made fancy tweaks to the django administrative interface.
