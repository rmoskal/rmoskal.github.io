Created a cms and publishing system for "long tail" content that constitutes the institutional memory for Foundation for Advancement in Conservation (FAIC). cOOL is an archive of some quarter of a million documents that include web sites, journals, and email lists dating back to the 1980s. It's an authoritative and invaluable resource for museum conservators from around the world.

This is here because it's the sort of thing thing it's worth contacting me for and is representative of the way I work in 2019.  I used open source software and the cloud to solve a problem simply and elegantly while along the way giving improving two of the open source tools I used: <a href="https://github.com/pgherveou/gulp-awspublish" target="_blank">gulp-awspublish</a> and <a href="https://github.com/etylsarin/gulp-ssi"  target="_blank">gulp-ssi</a>
