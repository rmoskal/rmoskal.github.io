A small team (including <a href="https://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=41" target="_blank">John Klima</a>), Prof. David Eltis, and Cambridge Univerity press,  created the pioneering  <u>Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database</u>. This was the first widely available digital tools for the research and analysis of the Atlantic trade from the sixteenth through the mid-nineteenth century
This milestone project languished for more than two years when principal after principal proved incapable of producing a powerful research/teaching tool that fulfilled the vision of its compilers. The biggest challenge was to enable manipulation of a large  dataset, including statistical analysis of query results, graphing, and geographical display running on the gamut of desktop computers circa 1999.
To maximize performance and minimize external dependencies we developed in Delphi using an embedded database. The resulting application ran on every version of Windows available in 1999. The ArcView component from ESRI to provided mapping capabilities. Our first foray into GIS. We completed the application in four months, on-time and on-budget. It has proven to be an invaluable teaching and research tool winning a Frederick Douglas award.
