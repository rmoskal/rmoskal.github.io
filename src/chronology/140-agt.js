  My involvement with AGT began with a gift/experiment. Could tech behind Itchy Knows, my hashtag aggregator, improve SEO for a directory site with more than 10 million pages.

  Soon I was doing a lot more. My clients ability to progress and adapt was ham-strung by a legacy code-base that had been worked over by many hands over the course of a dozen years. I felt compelled to help.

  Working on my own and directing the efforts of a series of development partners it's now a modern and evolvable set of applications in PHP and python/apache beam for etl.
  
  Along the way, I've become schooled in issues that arise when you have a statistically significant number of web pages (especially with regard to SEO), pretty good at defending a busy site against attackers, and am now a competent PHP programmer (though if there's such a thing as idiomatic php, I don't think I write it).
  
  Day to today operation of AGT is now in the hands of a team at <a target= "_blank" href="https://august99.com/">August 99</a> who are also strategic partner as Drew pivots into proptech. I continue as an advisor and fractional CTO.
