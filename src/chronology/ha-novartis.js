  The client required a sophisticated discussion forum to help solidify a far flung and diverse community of scientific researchers. The default SharePoint 2010 implementation didn't deliver on all of the requirements, and fell especially short in delivering community building features.

  After reviewing all the available third party packages, we proceeded with a custom SharePoint solution. We built out strong community building features such as voting, tracking and rewarding participation. The solution provides sophisticated taxonomy capabilities.
  
  The application was delivered as a set of features attached to any existing sub-site. To save on development costs, SharePoint lists were used for our data store and the native editing pages were used for all administrative functions.
  
  The look and feel is significantly different from SharePoint out of the box. A rich UI was provided using Flash and JQuery communicating with custom web services. The application also integrates with the PUBMED bibliographic database to allow researchers to share publications with others.
  
  My involvement with the project ended before I could gauge how it would received by the research community. However, I'm pleased to have provided community building tools that anticipated the features in later versions of SharePoint. As usual, the project was completed on time, on budget, and, with a minimum of fuss.
