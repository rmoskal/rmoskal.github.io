My friend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thuyen/">Thuyen Nguyen</a> thought that between us we could be the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norton">"Peter Norton</a> of OS/2, the Windows killer from IBM. Things didn't work that way, but it's a BIG book, and the os did have a long run in some sectors where a real time kernel was important. They tell me ours was the definitive work on the subject and that my chapter on threading was particularlly fine.
