  First I led the development effort of Playground Physics app for the NY Hall of Science along with my friends at <a href="https://www.bluetelescope.com/" target="_blank"> Blue Telescope</a>. We used am off-shore development team.

  After launch I mentored the Hall of Science team through the Verizon 5G incubator. There I mediated between the language and expectations of an established educational institution with a history of innovation and the culture of a tech incubator.
