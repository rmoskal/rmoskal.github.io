  Leading the build of this AA browser based RPG is part of my ongoing collaboration with DarkRoast Media.

The biggest challenges on this project was growing and managing a development team for a non-traditionally funded project (everyone took a cut in rate in exchange for points on the back end). Another was keeping the codebase responsive to changes in the creative content and game rules.

Using javascript up and down the stack reduced conceptual surface area and made new developers productive more quickly. Significant amounts of code of was shared between the client and server, largely doing away with the distinction between front and back end developers. Having nearly a thousand automated tests allowed us to to progress quickly and safely, even with a revolving cast of developers. Finally, Angular kept the team disciplined in the browser (where spaghetti code is all too frequently still the norm). Angular is an opinionated framework. It enforces coding practices and patterns that might seem harsh. But it prevents folks from going astray.

We kept up with changing creative, and game mechanics, by driving business rules from the contents of google spreadsheets which could be loaded directly into our datastore. Our creative team could experiment with game parameters and see the effects in the game world almost instantly.

Fueled by two rounds of private investment, the team made great progress for 14 months. Unfortunately we weren't able to secure more funding and shuttered the project. Many of the folks on the team have continued working together over the years.
