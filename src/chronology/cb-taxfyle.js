  Helped this tax preparation startup get to market for the 2016 tax season. In 2022, they closed a $20mm series B round. Congratulations!

While the internal team burned the midnight oil to deliver an IOS and Android application using React Native, Alvar and I created the portal to be used CPAs to service clients. We used flux/react on the front end, which was a pleasure and a revelation after working with Angular and Backbone for the last few years. Something like react is definitely the future of front end development.

While carrying on the portal work it became clear that many of the back end apis and integrations were not as far along as they needed to be. I juggled some other obligations and and dug inl. I moved the data from a simple in-memory database to mongodb, carried out the integration with the layers chat API, created a secure real-time push APIs, a secure document sharing system using S3, and transfomed business entities for consumption by clients.

As a result, Tax-fyle was able to bring a product to market for the 2016 tax season, greatly increasing the chance theyâ€™ll be the uber of accounting.
