  This sprawling property launched in 2008 has massive link authority (24,320th in the world) and generates a steady stream of SEO driven income.

  But SEO world keeps changing and my client needed to get ahead by exploring new business models: https://social.agreatertown.com. To speed the process, I've introduced the founder to lean startup practices like experimenting via minimal "build, measure, learn" iterations.
  
  The codebase was crippled by technical debt and abuse accrued over the last 12 years. Moreover it was built using techniques that were already obsolete at the turn of the century.
  
  2005 was calling and wanted its UX back! Yet it was almost impossible to make meaningful changes, such as introducing a mobile version, incrementally.
  
  We began by isolating old parts of the site and completely sistering them with new code. As of today, we've refashioned everything (except for the CMS) into a modern MVC style php application running serverless on gcloud. Priorities are: extensibility scalability and observability (especially with regard to the many ETL pipelines).
  
  Along the way, I've become schooled in the dark arts of SEO, have had to fight off hacking attempts, and have become a tolerably good PHP programmer.
  
  I look forward to helping my client continue innovating, while hopefully turning over day to day support to another team.
