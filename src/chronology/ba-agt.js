  My involvement in A Greater Town began with my gifting the owner with some parts of Itchy Knows, my hashtag aggregator. We aggregated posts from various social media platforms on the AGT town pages.

  Soon I was doing more for this sprawling property that generates a substantial amount of SEO driven income. I think it started as a baby bird sort of thing. The codebase was crippled by technical debt and abuse accrued over the last 12 years. Moreover it was built using techniques that were already obsolete at the turn of the century and was riddled with security holes  I wanted to nurse it back to health!

  I've worked with a number of off-shore teams to modernize the application. It's now a pretty standard php MVC application. 


I've worked with the founder to open up new lines of business and have  to lean startup practices like experimenting via minimal "build, measure, learn" iterations.  I myself have become schooled in the dark arts of SEO, and have become a tolerably good PHP programmer, and maybe better than I was at working with legacy code..
  
This year, I've begun transitioning routine development for the site to a new off-shore partner, and will continue my relationship with Drew Knapp as an advisor.
