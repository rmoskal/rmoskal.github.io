    It's nice to get back to basics: collaborating to create tools that empower people to work better.

    The museum at Williams College is moving to a beautiful new facility and all agreed using the current art handling system would be torture.
    
    <a href="https://concretecomputing.com/">Matt Morgan</a> and I conducted interviews, shadowed the art handlers, shopped for scanners, work-shopped solutions, and integrated with their collections management system <a href="https://www.gallerysystems.com/tms-collections/tms-suite/tms/tms/" target="_blank">TMS</a>.  
     
    We delivered the first production version of the system in the summer of 2024 and look forward continue to work with the museum to enhance it.
    
    On the tech side I purposefully kept things simple. I settled on the excellent PocketBase system that delivers a backend in a single file along with SvelteKit which I think will be my goto web framework for new development.
