  I worked with the learning group at this leading software manufacturer to create a road map for integrating CBT (Computer Based Training) production with the companies global content management system. 
  Our goal was to create a single source of authoritative product information that could be used by both the documentation and learning groups, eliminating the cost of creating and maintaining redundant content. 
  Our road map detailed two approaches: the enhancement of the XMetal authoring tool to support LCMS specific features, and a path for integrating the Thinking Cap LCMS with the Vasont content management system.
