  An educational non-profit outsourced the development of a suite of applications/web sites. The organization and applications were thriving, but they suffered greatly from vendor lock-in.

  The dependencies for each application were quite complex and specified nowhere but on the developer workstations and the server deployments. My client was unable to to work with more responsive and less expensive resources to evolve the applications and they were being beaten down by exhorbitant hosting fees. They were stuck!
  
  The suite was created in symfony2 and used compose to handle dependencies. However this didnâ€™t account for all the operating system level dependencies, not to mention the complete python, ruby, and java environments the symfony toolchain requires. That's one crazy toolchain, btw!
  
  I identified the dependencies for each application and made them explicit through a series of docker and docker-compose files. A development environment, including the support database could be spun up by running a single script. We used docker and the docker-cloud to deploy to digital ocean with a single click. In production we used compose.io to host a mongo database cluster in the same digital ocean data center.
  
  Hosting costs went from $10K to .5K per month! The organization is no longer dependent on the original developer for maintenance and enhancements. New developers can be onboarded and be productive within hours. When part of the organization split off, we were able to migrate its entire infrastructure in hours.
