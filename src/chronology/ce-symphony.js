  An educational non-profit outsourced the development of a suite of applications/web sites. The organization and applications were thriving, but they suffered mightily from vendor lock-in.

  The dependencies for each application were quite complex and specified nowhere but on the developer workstations and the server deployments. My client was unable to to work with more responsive and less expensive resources and were being pummelled with exhorbitant hosting fees. They were stuck!
  
  The suite was created in symfony2 and used compose to handle dependencies. However this didnâ€™t account for all the operating system level dependencies, not to mention the complete python, ruby, and java environments the symfony toolchain requires. That's one crazy toolchain, btw!
  
  I identified the dependencies for each application and made them explicit through a series of docker and docker-compose files. A development environment, including the support database could be spun up by running a single script. We used docker and the docker-cloud to deploy to automatically deploy to digital ocean. 

  Hosting costs went from $10,000 to $400 per month! The organization is no longer dependent on the original consultants and the savinsg go to improving the product. New developers can be onboarded and be productive within hours. When part of the organization split off, we were able to migrate its entire infrastructure in hours.
