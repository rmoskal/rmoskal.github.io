Like instagram, but for extreme sports practitioners, and 7 years too early (no really!).
  
Drawing on lessons learned over five years of server side java development, I'd put in place sort of service oriented stack that companies like Airbnb, Spotify, and Uber still use in 2022.  

I marketed this hard to adventure travel companies for 3 years, but it turns out that I was way, way ahead of the tech adoption curve. On the plus side this tech stack and style of development served me well for almost s decade. Plus I got tax deductions for trips to Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and British Columbia.
