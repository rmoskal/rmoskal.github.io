  With a successful portfolio of free IOS and Blackberry based electronic headache diaries, our clients next move was a web based version with more sophisticated reporting and analysis capabilities that also allowed patients to share data with physicians and other health care providers.

  A limited budget (after all, their software is free to use!) necessitated an approach and a set of technologies that would maximize chances of reaching an ambitious goal of building two commercial quality web applications essentially for the price of one.
  
  Sencha Ext JS provided a rich and consistent user experience without the need to over-design and fuss with front end elements. Crucially, we saved hundreds of hours of development time using a third party calendaring control. The nature of the headache information lent itself to being stored in the CouchDB nosql database.
  
  Perhaps our biggest win was in using Maven to generate two sites (one for patients and one for health care professionals) from the same source. This went a long way towards getting the project done within tight budgetary constraints.
