  I started coding itchy almost to the day that the Paul Berry, the Huffington Post CTO, started building Rebel Mouse, the social media publishing platform that started out as a hashtag aggregator.

I actively pursued the the project for two years. In its current incarnation itchy is used for sharing hash tagged images in instagram, flickr, and twitter, usually for events. Here is an example: The Great Pupkin.

I've been able to reuse large parts of the technology for a number of projects, icluding SEO enhancements for agreatertown.
