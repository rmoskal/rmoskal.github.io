  I started coding Itchy about the same time everyone <a target= "_blank" href="https://www.flatheadenterprises.com/seo/hashtags-tint-vs-tagboard-vs-twubs-vs-postano-vs-rebel-mouse/">else</a> started working on hash tag aggregators, maybe a few days earlier.

I actively pursued the the project for two years. When I shuttered it, I left behind several hundred dissapointed users.

I've been able to reuse large parts of the technology for a number of projects, icluding SEO enhancements for agreatertown.
