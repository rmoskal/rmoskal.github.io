  Thinking there was value and perhaps a business opportunity in bringing some order to the chaotic world of social media, I started coding Itchy when everyone else started working on <a target= "_blank" href="https://www.flatheadenterprises.com/seo/hashtags-tint-vs-tagboard-vs-twubs-vs-postano-vs-rebel-mouse/"> on social media aggregators </a>, maybe a few weeks earlier.

  Folks liked it and used it. They would create <b>#hashtags</b> for events like proms, festivals, corporate meetings, etc. Itchy would monitor facebook, twitter, and instagram for images with the tags and shunt them to a facebook page, a tumblr, or a custom website.
   I worked on Itchy for two years. I would have continued, but had to shutter it when instagram discontinued it's public search API which made a big chunk of the internet go dark. Itchy left behind several hundred disappointed users.
Itchy marked my first big python based system.  The python eco-system is cushy enough, but I find coding in the language not to my taste.  I'm glad I was able to pivot to node/javascript about the same time.
Fortunately I was able to reuse large parts of the Itchy on a number of studio projects, including SEO enhancements for agreatertown.
