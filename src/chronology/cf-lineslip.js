  I facilitated a series of workshops for the industry experts/founders intent on bringing efficiencies to the commercial insurance process.

  We were able to forge a common understanding and vision for an initial roadmap for their risk marketing and business intelligence Platform.
  
  I produced a vision document that enabled the development team to scope and architect the offering that was successfully brought to market last 2017. Congratulations!
