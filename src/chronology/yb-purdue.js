  Carried out custom application development for the research and development division of this pharmaceutical company along with a team I put together.

  I originally won the business away from a poorly performing vendor and carried forward work for which internal IT resources were ill-suited.
  
  Our collaboration grew into a suite of some half dozen enterprise applications (with the technology split between J2EE and .net applications). These included project management applications (including work flow, calendaring, and document management), business intelligence dashboards, and payment and clinical trial management systems. Most notable was project.pharma, the system of record for the firm's drug development pipeline and a clinical investigator payment application that ran uninterruptedly for some 8 years.
  
  Towards the end of the engagement, we began moving much of the suites features into SharePoint. When the company decided to move away from bespoke applications, we lead the transition and so engineered ourselves out of an engagement.
