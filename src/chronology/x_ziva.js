  My partner estimated the production of this large scale web portal providing localized and personalized health care information to consumers would require nine months. Their client wanted it in three.
  
  To meet this super aggressive schedule, I drew on my relationships and assembled and oversaw the efforts of a large, heterogeneous development team.
  
  My deep experience in developing content management and electronic publishing systems enabled me to foresee what would be required of a system that would aggregate personalized content from a multitude of sources including web services, relational databases, and even legacy formats like the Cobol extract files.
  
  Thorough unit test coverage ensured deep changes could be made to the system in response to fluid and ill defined customer requirements. Our continued reliance on lightweight J2EE development helped mitigate the risks of a large, heterogeneous development effort. The Spring framework greatly simplified application configuration and integration of of different principal contributions. We used its aspect oriented features to greatly reduce the amount of code we had to write. The latest version of Hibernate handled the task of mapping objects to the postgres database and eliminated the need to create separate mapping files.
  
  The site went live on schedule to the ultimate clients satisfaction. The client, unfortunately went ahead and stiffed us for a large portion of bill.
