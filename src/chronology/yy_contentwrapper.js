  Created a content management/sales force automation system sold by partners such as  BI Performance, Caribiner International, and Badiyan Productions to numerous Fortune 500 companies.
  
  <b>contentWrapper</b> had the following advanced features:
  
      A media library comprised of multimedia assets and Microsoft Office Documents. Item descriptions were indexed and fully searchable. Elements were easily manipulated and could be remixed while preserving brand messaging.
      The ability to be “skinned” for unique branding.
      Facilities for manipulating the contents of the library and Office applications, making it easy to create value added applications like proposal and presentation generators.
      An authoring system that made it  easy for licensees to update the media library and publish new editions of the contentWrapper.
