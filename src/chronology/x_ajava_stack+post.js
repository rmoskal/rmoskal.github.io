  Me, championing Java as a web development stack in the face of rise of Ruby on Rails.
   It was the rant of java developer hoping to use the same tools everywhere. In fact the opposite happened. 
   Javascript colonized the backend, and for the most part, for the better!

   Biggest mistake: placing a bet on Wicket as a frontend framework.  
   I foisted an number of Wicket applications on clients who then had difficulty finding people to maintain them.
